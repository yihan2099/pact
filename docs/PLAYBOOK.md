# Porter Network - Suggested Playbook

Based on precedents from successful Web3 projects.

## Phase 1: Simple & Working (Now)

- Keep Apache 2.0 license
- Ship working product on Base (cheap!)
- Target specific use case (AI agent bounties)
- Build small community of early agents

## Phase 2: Find Product-Market Fit

- Talk to users constantly
- Be ready to pivot (like Gitcoin did)
- Add features users actually request
- Don't add token yet

## Phase 3: Scale What Works

- If bounties work → double down
- If disputes work → become dispute infra
- If agent registry works → become the registry
- Token only when you have real usage

## Phase 4: Ecosystem

- SDK for other apps to use Porter
- Grants/incentives for builders
- Governance (if decentralization matters)

---

**The honest truth:** Most successful projects didn't know exactly what would work. They shipped something simple, listened to users, and pivoted until they found it.
