## Smart Contract Upgradeability Strategy

### Current State: Immutable Contracts

Porter Network contracts are currently **non-upgradeable** (immutable). Every version update requires deploying new contracts at new addresses.

**How Version Updates Work Today:**
1. Make contract changes (e.g., bug fix, new feature)
2. Deploy entirely new contracts → new addresses
3. Update `packages/contracts/src/addresses/*.ts` with new addresses
4. Redeploy all services (MCP server, indexer, web app) to point to new contracts
5. Old contracts remain on-chain but become inactive

**Version Types:**
- **Patch (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, security patches
- **Minor (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)**: New features (backward compatible)
- **Major (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)**: Breaking changes (interface changes, state changes)

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros**: Simpler code, lower gas costs, more secure (no upgrade risks), transparent to users
- ❌ **Cons**: Cannot fix bugs without redeployment, users must migrate, data migration complexity

### Path to Upgradeability

If frequent updates or bug fixes become necessary, consider implementing upgradeability for v2.0.0.

#### Option 1: Transparent Proxy Pattern (OpenZeppelin)

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Phase 1: Add OpenZeppelin Upgrades**
  ```bash
  cd apps/contracts
  forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable
  ```

- [ ] **Phase 2: Convert Contracts to Upgradeable**
  - [ ] Replace constructors with `initialize()` functions using `initializer` modifier
  - [ ] Inherit from `*Upgradeable` base contracts (e.g., `OwnableUpgradeable`)
  - [ ] Add storage gaps (`uint256[50] private __gap`) to all contracts
  - [ ] Remove immutable variables (proxies don't support them)
  - [ ] Update TaskManager dependencies (EscrowVault, DisputeResolver) to be mutable

- [ ] **Phase 3: Create Proxy Deployment Script**
  - [ ] Deploy implementation contracts (TaskManager, EscrowVault, etc.)
  - [ ] Deploy ProxyAdmin contract
  - [ ] Deploy TransparentUpgradeableProxy for each contract
  - [ ] Initialize proxies with constructor args
  - [ ] Transfer ProxyAdmin ownership to multisig/timelock

- [ ] **Phase 4: Implement Upgrade Workflow**
  - [ ] Create upgrade script: `script/Upgrade.s.sol`
  - [ ] Add tests for upgrade scenarios (storage layout, state preservation)
  - [ ] Document upgrade process in runbook
  - [ ] Set up multisig or timelock for upgrade governance

**Example Contract Changes:**
```solidity
// Before (immutable)
contract TaskManager is Ownable {
    IEscrowVault public immutable escrowVault;

    constructor(address _escrow) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        escrowVault = IEscrowVault(_escrow);
    }
}

// After (upgradeable)
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

contract TaskManager is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable {
    IEscrowVault public escrowVault; // no longer immutable

    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }

    function initialize(address _escrow) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init(msg.sender);
        escrowVault = IEscrowVault(_escrow);
    }

    uint256[49] private __gap; // storage gap
}
```

**Upgrade Flow:**
```bash
# 1. Deploy new implementation
forge script script/UpgradeTaskManager.s.sol --rpc-url base_sepolia

# 2. Upgrade proxy (via ProxyAdmin)
cast send $PROXY_ADMIN \
  "upgrade(address,address)" \
  $TASK_MANAGER_PROXY \
  $NEW_IMPLEMENTATION \
  --rpc-url base_sepolia

# 3. No need to update addresses in services (proxy address stays same)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fix bugs without changing addresses
- ✅ Add features incrementally
- ✅ Preserve all existing state/data
- ✅ Users don't need to migrate

**Risks:**
- ❌ Storage layout collisions (must maintain order)
- ❌ Centralization risk (upgrade key compromise)
- ❌ Higher gas costs (~2000 gas per delegatecall)
- ❌ Increased complexity (initializers, storage gaps)

#### Option 2: Diamond Pattern (EIP-2535)

For advanced use cases with selective upgrades:

- [ ] **Implement Diamond Pattern**
  - [ ] Split contracts into "facets" (TaskFacet, SubmissionFacet, etc.)
  - [ ] Deploy DiamondCutFacet, DiamondLoupeFacet
  - [ ] Create Diamond proxy
  - [ ] Add/remove/replace facets as needed

**Best for:**
- Large, modular systems (100+ functions)
- Selective feature upgrades
- Complex state management

**Trade-off:** Much higher complexity, only worth it for very large systems

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Immutable core + Upgradeable periphery:**

```solidity
// IMMUTABLE: Security-critical core
contract TaskManagerCore {
    // Core: task creation, escrow, finalization
    // Never changes after audit
}

// UPGRADEABLE: Feature extensions
contract TaskManagerExtensions is UUPSUpgradeable {
    ITaskManagerCore public immutable core;

    // Extensions: search, filters, reputation algorithms
    // Can iterate without risk
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Security-critical code is immutable (trusted)
- ✅ Can iterate on features safely
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Decision Points

**Stay Immutable If:**
- ✅ Infrequent updates (every 3-6+ months)
- ✅ Security is paramount (DeFi, high-value)
- ✅ Contract logic is stable and well-tested
- ✅ Users value transparency over flexibility

**Switch to Upgradeable If:**
- ❌ Frequent bug fixes needed (rapid iteration)
- ❌ New features added regularly
- ❌ User migration is too disruptive
- ❌ Competitive pressure requires fast updates

**Current Recommendation:** Stay immutable for MVP/v1.x, reassess after mainnet launch and 3-6 months of stability data.

### Governance & Security

If implementing upgradeability:

- [ ] **Add Timelock Contract**
  - 48-hour delay on upgrades
  - Community can review changes before execution
  - Emergency pause function (separate from upgrade)

- [ ] **Set Up Multisig**
  - Use Gnosis Safe or similar
  - Require 3-of-5 or 4-of-7 signatures
  - Distribute keys across team members

- [ ] **Implement Upgrade Process**
  1. Deploy new implementation to testnet
  2. Test upgrade on testnet fork
  3. Post upgrade proposal on governance forum
  4. 48h community review period
  5. Multisig approves upgrade
  6. Timelock executes after delay
  7. Monitor for 24h post-upgrade

- [ ] **Emergency Procedures**
  - Pause functionality (separate from upgrade)
  - Emergency multisig for critical fixes
  - Clear escalation path

### Testing Strategy for Upgrades

- [ ] **Storage Layout Tests**
  ```solidity
  // Test that storage slots match between versions
  function test_StorageLayoutUnchanged() public {
      // Use forge-std storage assertions
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Upgrade Simulation Tests**
  ```solidity
  function test_UpgradePreservesState() public {
      // 1. Deploy v1, create tasks
      // 2. Upgrade to v2
      // 3. Verify all tasks still exist and functional
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Fork Testing**
  ```bash
  # Test upgrades against mainnet fork
  forge test --fork-url $BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL
  ```

## Design Review Issues

Issues identified during architectural review (2026-02-02). Organized by severity.

### High Priority (P1)

#### Smart Contracts - Centralization Risk
- [ ] **Owner privileges too broad** - `TaskManager` and `DisputeResolver` owners can replace critical contract addresses (`setDisputeResolver`, `setPorterRegistry`) and withdraw slashed stakes
  - Risk: Single point of failure; owner compromise allows fund theft via malicious contract replacement
  - Recommendation: Add timelock (e.g., 48h delay) or multisig for admin functions, or make addresses immutable after deployment
  - Files: `apps/contracts/src/TaskManager.sol:77-87`, `apps/contracts/src/DisputeResolver.sol`

#### MCP Server - Session Storage
- [x] ~~**In-memory session storage**~~ - **RESOLVED**: Now uses Redis with in-memory fallback
  - Sessions persist across restarts via Upstash Redis
  - Supports horizontal scaling
  - File: `apps/mcp-server/src/auth/session-manager.ts`

#### MCP Server - Dispute Tools
- [x] ~~**MCP tools for dispute flow**~~ - **RESOLVED**: All dispute tools implemented
  - Implemented: `get_dispute`, `list_disputes`, `start_dispute`, `submit_vote`, `resolve_dispute`
  - Files: `apps/mcp-server/src/tools/dispute/*.ts`

### Medium Priority (P2)

#### Smart Contracts - Gas/Safety
- [ ] **Unbounded voter loop** - `DisputeResolver.resolveDispute()` iterates all voters to update reputation
  - Risk: Could exceed block gas limit with many voters
  - Recommendation: Cap voters per dispute, or batch resolution, or off-chain reputation with Merkle proofs
  - File: `apps/contracts/src/DisputeResolver.sol:210-218`

- [x] ~~**No reentrancy guard**~~ - **RESOLVED**: Added OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` to EscrowVault and DisputeResolver
  - Files: `apps/contracts/src/EscrowVault.sol`, `apps/contracts/src/DisputeResolver.sol`

- [ ] **No SafeERC20 for token transfers** - `TaskManager.createTask` doesn't verify ERC20 transfers
  - Risk: Non-standard ERC20 tokens may fail silently
  - Recommendation: Use `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` in `EscrowVault.deposit`
  - File: `apps/contracts/src/TaskManager.sol:127-128`

- [ ] **Hardcoded time constants** - `CHALLENGE_WINDOW`, `VOTING_PERIOD`, `SELECTION_DEADLINE` can't be adjusted
  - Risk: No flexibility without contract redeployment
  - Recommendation: Make governance-controllable or owner-adjustable with bounds
  - Files: `apps/contracts/src/TaskManager.sol`, `apps/contracts/src/DisputeResolver.sol`

#### Database
- [ ] **Numeric values stored as strings** - `bounty_amount` stored as TEXT requiring RPC functions for comparison
  - Impact: Query complexity, potential performance issues
  - Recommendation: Use PostgreSQL `NUMERIC` type, or store both wei (string) and ETH (numeric) columns
  - File: `packages/database/src/queries/task-queries.ts:44-47`

#### Indexer - Reliability
- [ ] **Single contract checkpoint** - Only `taskManager` address is checkpointed
  - Risk: Events from other contracts could be missed on crash between processing
  - Recommendation: Checkpoint per contract, or use transaction-based checkpointing
  - File: `apps/indexer/src/listener.ts:298`

- [ ] **No dead letter queue** - Failed event processing is logged but not retried
  - Risk: Critical events could be silently dropped
  - Recommendation: Implement DLQ or persistent retry mechanism
  - File: `apps/indexer/src/listener.ts:306-308`

- [ ] **No idempotency in handlers** - Events could be processed twice on restart if checkpoint fails
  - Risk: Duplicate database entries
  - Recommendation: Use database transactions or upserts with unique constraints
  - File: `apps/indexer/src/handlers/`

### Low Priority (P3)

#### Smart Contracts - Bugs
- [ ] **`refundExpiredTask` bug** - Tasks without deadlines always revert
  - Issue: `selectionDeadline` calculation incomplete, function always reverts for deadline-less tasks
  - File: `apps/contracts/src/TaskManager.sol:287-289`

#### MCP Server - Edge Cases
- [x] ~~**Registration status caching**~~ - **RESOLVED**: Added `checkAccessWithRegistrationRefresh()` function
  - Re-checks on-chain registration status for registered-level tools
  - Updates session if agent registered mid-session
  - File: `apps/mcp-server/src/auth/access-control.ts`

- [x] ~~**No rate limiting on auth tools**~~ - **RESOLVED**: Rate limiting applied to all /tools/* endpoints
  - File: `apps/mcp-server/src/http-server.ts`

- [x] ~~**Challenge predictability**~~ - **RESOLVED**: Challenges include timestamp, nonces stored by UUID, 5-minute expiration
  - File: `apps/mcp-server/src/auth/wallet-signature.ts`

#### MCP Server - Profile Updates
- [x] ~~**No `update_profile` tool**~~ - **RESOLVED**: Tool implemented
  - File: `apps/mcp-server/src/tools/agent/update-profile.ts`

#### Architecture
- [ ] **Staleness indicators missing** - MCP reads from Supabase but doesn't indicate if indexer is behind
  - Impact: Agents may see stale data without knowing
  - Recommendation: Add staleness indicators to responses, or health checks for indexer lag

#### Performance
- [ ] **Sequential event processing** - Events processed one at a time in indexer
  - Impact: Throughput limited during high activity
  - Recommendation: Parallel processing with ordering constraints only where necessary
  - File: `apps/indexer/src/listener.ts:290-292`

- Request signing for IPFS uploads (prove ownership)
- Database audit logging for compliance

### Security Configuration

```bash
# .env security settings
HOST=127.0.0.1                    # Don't bind to 0.0.0.0 in production
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com  # Restrict to known origins
NODE_ENV=production               # Enables HSTS header
